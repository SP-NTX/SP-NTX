# 🇵🇱 SP-NTX 

    Hated by a majority for having a different opinion than others,

    Forgotten by the rest,

    Admired by a few,

    Loved by some.

But you have to admit that I am a nice guy

## ❔ Who am I?
I am a FlightGear Pilot and Developer from Poland 🇵🇱. I'm also a plane spotter 🛩️, sailor ⛵, photographer 📷, guitarist 🎸, programmer 💻, 3D modeller ✏️, and so on...

I founded the FlightGear Polska community in 2020. Since then, I've been the owner and administrator of it.
